    <u><h2 align="center">Installations to run the application locally</h2></u>
</p>

- First create a Firebase Project
-  Generate an serviceAccountkey for your firebase project. Go to your ```Firebase project -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts``` and download the firebase SDK by clicking ```Generate New Private Key``` button
- Rename the file to ``` serviceAccountKey.json ``` and put it in the root folder. The file will look like this
```
 {
  "type": ,
  "project_id": ,
  "private_key_id": ,
  "private_key": ,
  "client_email": ,
  "client_id": ,
  "auth_uri": ,
  "token_uri": ,
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": ,
  "client_x509_cert_url": 
}
```
- To install all the dependencies run 
```bash
npm i
```

<p align="center">

- Run Locally
  - To run the application locally, start up your terminal /command prompt ,and go to the project folder and then run the following command
```bash
node index.js

<p align="center">
    <u><h2 align="center">Future Features</h2></u>
</p>

- Make the UI interface for the app
- Update the create inventory request so that it accepts images as well.


<p align="center">
    <u><h2 align="center">Note for Shopify Developers</h2></u>
</p>

- If required I will migrate to aws or gcp in the future releases.
-  Currently the create inventory request only accepts two body parameters which are `item name` and `quantity`, if required i can update it and store more metadata such as expirty date, product_condition,shipment date,etc
