    <u><h2 align="center">Installations to run the application locally</h2></u>
</p>

- First create a Firebase Project
-  Generate an serviceAccountkey for your firebase project. Go to your ```Firebase project -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts``` and download the firebase SDK by clicking ```Generate New Private Key``` button
- Rename the file to ``` serviceAccountKey.json ``` and put it in the root folder. The file will look like this
```
 {
  "type": ,
  "project_id": ,
  "private_key_id": ,
  "private_key": ,
  "client_email": ,
  "client_id": ,
  "auth_uri": ,
  "token_uri": ,
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": ,
  "client_x509_cert_url": 
}
```
- To install all the dependencies run 
```bash
npm i
```

<p align="center">
    <u><h2 align="center">How to Run it</h2></u>
</p>

- Run on Replit
  - To run the application on Replit, just go to the following link : https://replit.com/@PritishPanda/Shopify-Fall-2022-Challenge and fork the repo.
  - Once you fork it you can add your own serviceAccountKey.json or you could use mine which already exist in replit and run the app
- Run Locally
  - To run the application locally, start up your terminal /command prompt ,and go to the project folder and then run the following command
```bash
node index.js
```
